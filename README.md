# README - Szachy

## Description

This program runs on both Windows and Linux systems.  
It requires Python version 3 to work.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Additional requirements for Linux

On Linux systems, the `tkinter` module must be installed separately,  
because it is not included with the standard Python library on most Linux distributions.

To install `tkinter` on Ubuntu/Debian, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

## Running the program

1. Open the terminal (Linux) or command prompt (Windows).

2. Navigate to the folder containing the program.

3. Run the program with the command:


        python3 Szachy.py


Note: On Windows, you may need to use python instead of python3.
