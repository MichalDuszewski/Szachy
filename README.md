# README - Szachy

## Description

Basic local 2 player chess app. Supports all standard rules, including promotion and en passant, as well as draw by agreement, threefold repetition and stalemate.

## Requirements

- Windows/Linux
- Python 3.x

## Additional requirements for Linux

On Linux systems, the `tkinter` module must be installed separately, as it is not included with the standard Python library on most Linux distributions.

To install `tkinter` on Ubuntu/Debian, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

## Running the program

1. Open the terminal (Linux) or command prompt (Windows).

2. Navigate to the folder containing the program.

3. Run the program with the command:


        python3 Szachy.py


Note: On Windows, you may need to use "python" instead of "python3".
